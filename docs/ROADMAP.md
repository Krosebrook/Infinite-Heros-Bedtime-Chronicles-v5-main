## Backlog (Prioritized)

### High Priority

| # | Item | Value | Criticality | Risk | Size | WSJF | Notes |
|---|------|-------|-------------|------|------|------|-------|
| 1 | Upgrade to Expo SDK 55 | 5 | 8 | 5 | 3 | 6.0 | Removes need for expo-asset patch (TODO in patches/) |

|---|------|-------|-------------|------|------|------|-------|
| 9 | Add persistent rate limiting (Redis) | 3 | 1 | 3 | 3 | 2.3 | Current in-memory is sufficient for single-instance |
| 10 | Add authentication | 5 | 1 | 3 | 8 | 1.1 | Only needed if costs become a concern |
| 11 | Encrypt client-side storage | 2 | 1 | 2 | 5 | 1.0 | Data is non-sensitive (stories, badges) |

## Dependencies

- Item 2 (Expo 55) blocks removal of `patches/expo-asset+12.0.12.patch`
- Item 4 (Voice chat UI) depends on audio recording permissions and expo-av
- Item 10 (Auth) would require significant architecture changes

## Tracked TODOs in Code

| Location | TODO | Blocked By |
|----------|------|------------|
| `patches/expo-asset+12.0.12.patch:9` | Remove HTTPS dev server patch | Expo SDK 55 upgrade |
