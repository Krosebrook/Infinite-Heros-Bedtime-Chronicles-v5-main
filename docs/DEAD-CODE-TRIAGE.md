## Triage Entries

---

### 1. `server/storage.ts:1-38`

**Type:** Orphaned export  
**What it does:** Defines `IStorage` interface, `MemStorage` class (in-memory user store with `getUser`, `getUserByUsername`, `createUser`), and exports a singleton `storage` instance. This is a server-side user storage layer.  
**Current replacement:** The app has no server-side user management. Client-side user/profile data is handled entirely by `lib/storage.ts` (AsyncStorage). No equivalent server-side logic exists.  
**Current replacement working?** N/A — server-side user storage is not a feature that currently exists in the app.  
**Recommendation:** KEEP_CURRENT  

No restore needed. This is scaffold code from the initial project template. It is not broken — it was never connected. It will become relevant if server-side user accounts are added in the future. Deleting it would be premature. Risk of keeping it: zero (it is never imported).

---

### 2. `components/HeroCard.tsx:1-103`

**Type:** Orphaned export / duplicate implementation  
**What it does:** A full 103-line `HeroCard` component — a pressable hero selection card with gradient background, power badge, and haptic feedback — accepting a `Hero` object and `onPress` handler. It is a complete, working component.  
**Current replacement:** `app/(tabs)/create.tsx:467` — heroes are rendered inline with `HEROES.map()` using bespoke JSX directly within the screen. The inline version has its own styling and selection state logic.  
**Current replacement working?** YES — the inline version in create.tsx is active and functional.
**Recommendation:** KEEP_CURRENT
**Decision:** KEEP_CURRENT (2026-03-13) — The inline version in create.tsx is tightly integrated with the carousel/swiper UX. HeroCard.tsx is retained for potential reuse if a hero card component is needed elsewhere (e.g., quick-create, profile screens). No risk keeping it dormant.

---

### 3. `components/KeyboardAwareScrollViewCompat.tsx:1-30`

**Type:** Orphaned export  
**What it does:** A thin platform-compatibility wrapper that renders `KeyboardAwareScrollView` from `react-native-keyboard-controller` on native, and falls back to a plain `ScrollView` on web. Marked `// template` at the top of the file, suggesting it was generated as starter scaffolding.  
**Current replacement:** Forms in the app (story-details.tsx, quick-create.tsx) use `ScrollView` directly without keyboard avoidance. No direct replacement — this feature is simply absent.  
**Current replacement working?** PARTIALLY — keyboard avoidance is missing from form screens; the component exists but nothing uses it.  
**Recommendation:** KEEP_CURRENT  

This component is not broken — it was never connected. It is a useful utility that the app would benefit from using in `story-details.tsx` (which has a text input that could be obscured by the keyboard). No regression risk to keeping it dormant. If the keyboard-obscures-input bug is reported, this is the fix.

---

### 4. `server/replit_integrations/` — entire directory

**Type:** Orphaned module set (4 subdirectories: `audio/`, `batch/`, `chat/`, `image/`)  
**What it does:**  
- `chat/` — OpenAI-powered multi-turn chat with conversation history stored in PostgreSQL via Drizzle ORM. Full routes: `POST /chat/message`, `GET /chat/history/:id`, `DELETE /chat/:id`.  
- `audio/` — OpenAI audio pipeline: speech-to-text, GPT-4o-audio responses, format conversion via ffmpeg. Routes for audio message/response cycle.  
- `image/` — Google Gemini image generation (separate from the main AI router). Route: `POST /generate-image`.  
- `batch/` — Rate-limiting and batch processing utilities (no routes, just helpers).  

**Current replacement:** `server/routes.ts` implements its own image generation via the multi-provider `AI Router` (Gemini → OpenAI fallback). Chat and audio have no equivalent in the current app. The main AI router (`server/ai/`) handles all text/image generation.  
**Current replacement working?** YES for image generation. Chat and audio have NO current equivalent.
**Recommendation:** WIRED_UP

**Tradeoff:**  
- `chat/` and `audio/` represent substantial features (voice-interactive chat with memory) that do not exist anywhere in the current app. If a "chat with your hero" or "voice narration input" feature is planned, this code is ready to be wired up.  
- `image/` overlaps with the existing AI router's image generation. The replit_integrations version uses Gemini only; the AI router version has multi-provider fallback. The AI router version is superior.  
- `batch/` utilities are generic rate-limit helpers that could be useful but are currently redundant with the inline rate-limiting in routes.ts.  

**Decision:** WIRED_UP (2026-03-13) — Audio routes (which include conversation management) are now registered in `server/routes.ts` via `registerAudioRoutes()`. They are gated behind `AI_INTEGRATIONS_OPENAI_API_KEY` and `DATABASE_URL` environment variables. The image module was NOT registered because the existing AI router has superior multi-provider fallback. The batch utilities remain available as imports for future use.

### 5. `lib/storage.ts` — Four orphaned exports

**Type:** Orphaned exports (4 functions never called from outside lib/storage.ts)

#### 5a. `lib/storage.ts:47` — `getReadStories()`
**What it does:** Returns an array of story IDs that have been marked as read, stored in AsyncStorage under `@read_stories`.  
**Current replacement:** None — read/unread tracking is not implemented in the current UI.  
**Current replacement working?** N/A  
**Recommendation:** KEEP_CURRENT — represents an unfinished "unread indicator" feature. No harm keeping it.

#### 5b. `lib/storage.ts:56` — `markStoryRead(storyId)`
**What it does:** Adds a story ID to the read-stories list.  
**Current replacement:** None.  
**Recommendation:** KEEP_CURRENT — companion to `getReadStories()` above.

#### 5c. `lib/storage.ts:101` — `saveStoryScene(storyId, partIndex, imageDataUri)`
**What it does:** Persists a generated story scene image (base64) into a cached story record, keyed by part index.  
**Status:** ✅ RESTORED (2026-03-13)  
**How restored:**  
- `app/story.tsx` — `loadSceneImage` now accepts a `partIndex` param and writes to `sceneCacheRef.current[partIndex]` on success. All three call sites updated.  
- `app/story.tsx` — `handleComplete` now passes `scenesJson: JSON.stringify(sceneCacheRef.current)` to the `/completion` route params.  
- `app/completion.tsx` — imports `saveStoryScene`, reads `scenesJson` param, and calls `saveStoryScene(storyId, partIndex, imageDataUri)` for each entry after `saveStoryWithProfile` returns the real story ID. The story ID bug (`storyId` generated before save, never matching the saved record) was also fixed — `storyId` is now the value returned by `saveStoryWithProfile`.

#### 5d. `lib/storage.ts:114` — `updateFeedback(storyId, rating, text)`
**What it does:** Attaches a `{ rating, text, timestamp }` feedback record to a saved story.  
**Current replacement:** None — the feedback/rating UI existed at some point (the `CachedStory` type in `constants/types.ts` still has a `feedback` field) but no UI currently captures or displays feedback.  
**Recommendation:** KEEP_CURRENT — represents an unfinished feedback/rating feature. Harmless.

---

### 6. Dual Settings Systems

**Type:** Duplicate implementation  

**System A (older):** `components/SettingsModal.tsx` + `constants/types.ts:UserPreferences` + `lib/storage.ts:getPreferences/savePreferences`  
- Stores in AsyncStorage key: `@preferences`  
- Covers: theme, notifications, auto-play, parental controls toggle, language  
- UI: A tabbed modal (general / voice / accessibility) opened from `create.tsx` and `profile.tsx`

**System B (newer, added by agent session):** `lib/SettingsContext.tsx` + `app/settings.tsx`  
- Stores in AsyncStorage key: `@infinity_heroes_app_settings`  
- Covers: audio volume, speed, voice, auto-play, story length, age range, auto-images, extend mode, auto-next, text size, library sort, favorites filter  
- UI: A standalone screen accessible from `index.tsx` via a gear icon

**Current replacement working?** Both were active and working independently. They did NOT sync.
**Recommendation:** MERGED
**Decision:** MERGED (2026-03-13) — SettingsModal.tsx now reads/writes via `useSettings()` from `SettingsContext` instead of its own `getPreferences`/`savePreferences`. System A's unique fields (`sleepTheme`, `isMuted`, `reducedMotion`, `fontSize`) were added to `AppSettings` in `SettingsContext.tsx`. A one-time migration in the SettingsProvider reads the old `@infinity_heroes_preferences` AsyncStorage key and merges values into the unified settings store. Both UIs now share a single source of truth.

## Completed Restorations

### Candidate 5c — `saveStoryScene` ✅ Done (2026-03-13)

Scene image persistence was the only clear regression in the codebase. All other candidates are either harmless scaffold or require a user decision.

**What was changed:**
- `app/story.tsx`: `loadSceneImage(partText)` → `loadSceneImage(partText, partIndex)`. Added `sceneCacheRef` to accumulate scenes. Passes `scenesJson` to `/completion` params.  
- `app/completion.tsx`: Reads `scenesJson` param, calls `saveStoryScene` for each entry after story save. Also fixed a pre-existing storyId mismatch bug (the ID generated before save was never the ID used in storage).

---

## Resolved Decisions (2026-03-13)

All three open decisions have been resolved:
1. **#2 HeroCard.tsx** — KEEP_CURRENT. Retained for potential reuse; no regression risk.
2. **#4 server/replit_integrations/** — WIRED_UP. Audio/chat routes registered in `server/routes.ts`, gated behind env vars.
3. **#6 Dual settings systems** — MERGED. `SettingsModal.tsx` now uses `useSettings()` from `SettingsContext`. Legacy preferences migrated on first load.
