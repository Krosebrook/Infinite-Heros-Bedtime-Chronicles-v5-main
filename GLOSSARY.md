# GLOSSARY.md — Domain Vocabulary

Alphabetical reference for all domain-specific terms, abbreviations, and internal jargon used in this codebase, commit messages, and documentation.

**Target audience:** New developer, AI coding agent, or non-technical stakeholder encountering these terms for the first time.

---

## A

**ADR** — Architecture Decision Record. A short document capturing a significant architectural decision: its context, the choice made, and the consequences. Stored in `docs/adr/`. See [docs/adr/README.md](./docs/adr/README.md).

**AI Router** — The multi-provider abstraction layer at `server/ai/index.ts` that routes AI requests through a priority fallback chain (Gemini → OpenAI → Anthropic → OpenRouter). Callers never interact with provider SDKs directly.

**AsyncStorage** — React Native's persistent key-value storage mechanism (similar to `localStorage` on the web). Used as the primary client-side data store for stories, profiles, settings, and badges. All access is through helpers in `lib/storage.ts`.

---

## B

**Badge** — A gamification achievement awarded after story completion. 12 badges total, defined in `lib/storage.ts`. Examples: "First Story", "Sleep Champion", "Mad Libs Master". Stored as `EarnedBadge[]` in AsyncStorage under `@infinity_heroes_badges`.

**Bedtime Chronicles** — The subtitle of the app. Refers to the collection of personalized bedtime stories created by a child across sessions.

---

## C

**CachedStory** — The TypeScript interface (`constants/types.ts`) for a saved story. Contains the full story JSON, scene images (as base64 data URIs), hero ID, mode, profile ID, and optional feedback. Stored in AsyncStorage under `@infinity_heroes_stories`.

**Child Profile** — A named profile representing a child user. Stores name, age, favorite hero ID, avatar emoji, and creation timestamp. Multiple profiles supported. Defined as `ChildProfile` in `constants/types.ts`.

**Child Safety Rules** — A system prompt constant (`CHILD_SAFETY_RULES`) injected into every story generation request. Enforces age-appropriate content (no violence, no scary content, positive values). Located in `server/prompts.ts`.

**Circuit Breaker** — A resilience pattern wrapping each AI provider in `server/circuit-breaker.ts`. Opens after 5 consecutive provider failures and resets after 60 seconds, preventing the AI router from repeatedly calling a failing provider.

**Classic Mode** — One of three story modes. Generates a traditional adventure story with 3–5 parts and branching choices. Identified as `"classic"` in the `mode` field.

**Completion Screen** — The screen shown after all story parts are read (`app/completion.tsx`). Awards badges, displays the vocabulary word and joke, and shows streak progress.

**Constellation** — A decorative attribute of each built-in hero (e.g., "The Shield", "The Wave"). Displayed in hero selection UI. Defined in `constants/heroes.ts`.

---

## D

**Data URI** — A base64-encoded image embedded directly in a string (e.g., `data:image/png;base64,...`). Used to store AI-generated scene images and avatars in AsyncStorage without a file server.

**Drizzle ORM** — The TypeScript ORM used for PostgreSQL database access (`drizzle-orm` package). Schema defined in `shared/schema.ts`. Used only for voice chat features.

**Duration** — Story length parameter. Valid values: `"short"`, `"medium-short"`, `"medium"`, `"long"`, `"epic"`. Controls the number of story parts and word count per part.

---

## E

**Expo** — The React Native framework and toolchain used for this app. Provides the SDK, build tools, file-based routing (Expo Router), and access to native APIs. Version: SDK 55.

**Expo Router** — Expo's file-based routing library (v6). Screen files in `app/` are automatically registered as routes. Tab screens are under `app/(tabs)/`.

---

## F

**Fallback Chain** — The ordered list of AI providers tried in sequence if the primary fails. Story chain: Anthropic → Gemini → OpenAI → Meta Llama → xAI → Mistral → Cohere. Image chain: Gemini → OpenAI. Implemented in `server/ai/router.ts`.

**Favorites** — Stories the user has starred. Stored as an array of story IDs in AsyncStorage under `@infinity_heroes_favorites`.

**Firebase** — Google's mobile/web platform used for anonymous authentication. The server validates Firebase ID tokens via Firebase Admin SDK (`server/auth.ts`). The client initializes anonymous sign-in via `lib/AuthContext.tsx`.

---

## G

**Gemini** — Google's AI model family. Used for image generation (`gemini-2.5-flash-image`) and as a fallback text provider (`gemini-2.5-flash`). Anthropic Claude is the primary story text provider.

**Glassmorphism** — The visual design style used in this app: semi-transparent cards with frosted-glass blur effects on a dark midnight/indigo/purple background.

---

## H

**Hero** — A pre-defined or custom superhero character. Pre-defined heroes are listed in `constants/heroes.ts`: Nova (Guardian of Light), Coral (Heart of the Ocean), Orion (Star of Friendship), Luna (Dream Weaver), Nimbus (Brave Cloud), Bloom (Garden Keeper), Whistle (Night Train Conductor), Shade (Shadow Friend). Custom heroes can have a user-provided name, title, and AI-generated avatar.

---

## I

**Idempotency Cache** — A server-side cache (`server/idempotency.ts`) that deduplicates expensive POST requests within a 5-minute TTL window using a hash of the request body as the key. Prevents duplicate AI story generation calls from network retries.

**Infinity Heroes** — The app name. The full title is "Infinity Heroes: Bedtime Chronicles".

---

## L

**Landing Page** — A branded HTML page served at `GET /` from the Express server. Targets parents/visitors discovering the app. Source: `server/templates/landing-page.html`.

**Library** — The tab screen (`app/(tabs)/library.tsx`) that shows saved stories. Supports sorting, filtering by favorites, and browsing story history.

**Load Shedding** — A server middleware (`server/load-shedding.ts`) that rejects incoming requests with 503 when the active-request count exceeds a configured ceiling. Prevents the server from becoming overwhelmed under spike traffic.

---

## M

**Mad Libs Mode** — One of three story modes. Fills user-provided words (noun, adjective, etc.) into a story template for a silly, comedic result. Identified as `"madlibs"` in the `mode` field.

**Memory Jar** — A feature allowing children to record memorable story moments. Referenced in UI but details depend on current implementation.

**Mode** — Story generation mode. One of: `"classic"` (adventure), `"madlibs"` (fill-in-the-blank comedy), `"sleep"` (calming/meditative).

---

## P

**Parent Controls** — Settings accessible via PIN (SHA-256 + salt hashed via expo-crypto; 5-attempt lockout) that restrict story content: max story length, bedtime scheduling, theme filtering. Stored as `ParentControls` in AsyncStorage under `@infinity_heroes_parent_controls`.

**Part** — A single segment of a story. A story contains 3–5 parts (depending on duration). Each part has text, optional branching choices, and an optional scene illustration. Defined as `StoryPart` in `constants/types.ts`.

**Pino** — Structured JSON logging library used by the Express server (`server/logger.ts`). All server log events are pino-formatted with timestamp, log level, and context fields.

---

## Q

**Quick Create** — An onboarding screen (`app/quick-create.tsx`) for first-time users to choose a theme and create their first story without going through the full hero creation flow.

---

## R

**Rate Limiter** — Server-side per-user request throttle. Sliding window algorithm, 10 requests/60 seconds by default. Keyed on Firebase UID when auth is active, falls back to client IP. Configurable via `RATE_LIMIT_MAX` and `RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS` env vars.

**Reading View** — The screen where a story is read and played back (`app/story.tsx`). Handles part progression, TTS playback, and scene image display.

**Replit** — The cloud development and deployment platform where this project was bootstrapped and primarily developed.

**Replit Connectors** — Replit's managed service integration mechanism. Used to auto-provision ElevenLabs API key and PostgreSQL without manual credential setup.
